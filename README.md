# introToCommandLine
An introductory short course on command line interface (CLI).
This course was offered as part of a Workshop on OpenFOAM in the Mechanical and Materials Engineering department at Queen's University.
The course is particularly useful for those students who:
- Will run computer simulation of some sort using high performance computing.
- Will use open source computational fluid dynamic software developed natively in Linux.
- Want to learn the inner beauties of the command line interface for personal knowledge.
- Want to create a new more productive workflow in their personal or academic life.
